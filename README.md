# oxideav-opus

Pure-Rust Opus audio codec (SILK + CELT) for the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV) framework.

## Status

**Clean-room rebuild in progress (orphan scaffold).** The prior
implementation was retired under the workspace clean-room policy; the
crate is being re-implemented from scratch against the published RFCs
using only material under `docs/` and black-box validator binaries.

A top-level `OpusDecoder::decode_packet` packet → PCM orchestration is
now in place: it parses the §3.1 TOC, splits the §3.2 frame packing
(all four frame-count codes), runs the §4.5 multi-frame loop, routes
each Opus frame by mode, and lays out the interleaved 48 kHz output
buffer (RFC 7845 §5.1) with correct per-frame sample counts. A **mono
SILK-only** packet runs the real §4.2 bitstream decode end-to-end (the
§4.2.3 header bits, the §4.2.5 LBRR / §4.2.6 regular SILK frame loop,
each frame decoded in Table-5 order through gains / LSF chain / LTP /
excitation, with inter-frame state threaded across frames). The
§4.2.7.9 LTP / LPC synthesis + §4.2.9 resample that turn the decoded
SILK parameters into 48 kHz samples — and the CELT layer's §4.3.2.1
coarse-energy decode — are the remaining decode milestones, so the
emitted PCM is currently silence (the bitstream is fully consumed and
the decoded parameters are exposed via `FrameDecodeStatus`). The crate
ships a large, individually unit-tested set of SILK and CELT decode
building blocks (~1145 lib tests). Per-stage progress lives in
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## What works

**Packet → PCM orchestration (RFC 6716 §3 / §4):**

- `OpusDecoder::decode_packet` — the top-level packet → interleaved
  48 kHz PCM path: TOC parse, §3.2 frame split, §4.5 multi-frame loop,
  per-mode routing, and the RFC 7845 §5.1 output sample-count layout.
  Mono SILK-only packets run the real §4.2 bitstream decode; other modes
  emit correct-length silence flagged via `FrameDecodeStatus`.
- `silk_decode::decode_silk_frame` — the §4.2.6 / §4.2.7 in-order SILK
  frame decode that composes the per-stage decoders in exact Table-5
  symbol order and runs the LSF → stable-Q12-LPC chain.

**Packet & framing (RFC 6716 §3 / §4.2):**

- `OpusTocByte` — the §3.1 TOC parser (config × stereo flag × frame-count
  code).
- `OpusPacket` — the §3.2 frame-packing parser for all four frame-count
  codes (single, two-equal, two-unequal, signalled with optional VBR
  lengths + padding); returned frame slices borrow from the input.
- `parse_self_delimited` — RFC 6716 Appendix B self-delimiting framing
  (for chaining inside a multistream demuxer).
- `OpusFrameRouting` — §3.1 / §4.2 mode dispatch (SILK-only / Hybrid /
  CELT-only, SILK-frame count, per-frame LBRR-flag gating, channel
  multiplier).
- A §3.4 R1–R7 malformed-input rejection audit
  (`tests/malformed_input.rs`).

**Range coder (RFC 6716 §4.1):** `RangeDecoder` — the shared entropy
primitive consumed by both layers, including the §4.1.2 two-step
`ec_decode` / `ec_dec_update` path and the Laplace / iCDF helpers.

**SILK (RFC 6716 §4.2):** frame-header decode (§4.2.7.1–§4.2.7.5.1),
subframe gains (§4.2.7.4), the full LSF chain (stage-2 residual → NLSF
reconstruction → stabilization → interpolation → NLSF→LPC →
bandwidth-expansion → prediction-gain limiting, §4.2.7.5.2–§4.2.7.5.8),
LTP parameters (§4.2.7.6), LCG seed (§4.2.7.7), excitation
(§4.2.7.8), LTP + LPC synthesis filters (§4.2.7.9), stereo unmixing
(§4.2.8), and the §4.2.9 resampler delay budget.

**CELT (RFC 6716 §4.3 / §4.5):** the §4.3 band layout (Table 55), the
pre-band header symbols (silence / post-filter / transient / intra),
the §4.3.4.5 *time-frequency change decode* (`celt_tf_decode` — the
per-band `tf_change` flag loop, first band absolute and subsequent
bands difference-coded relative to the previous band's choice, plus the
§4.3.1-gated `tf_select` flag and the resulting per-band TF adjustment
vector) layered on the §4.3.4.5 TF-resolution adjustment tables, the
coarse-energy Laplace
parameter tables (§4.3.2.1), the allocation parameter surfaces
(log2-frac / alloc-trim / cache-caps / static-allocation), the
§4.3.4.1 *Bits-to-Pulses* pulse-cost cache (the run-packed
`cache_bits50` / `cache_index50` lookup plus the budget-to-pulse-count
inversion), the §4.3.6 band denormalisation (unit-norm PVQ shape ×
`sqrt(2**log2_energy)`, laid out across the coded bands into the
inverse-MDCT input buffer), the §4.3.7 inverse MDCT transform core (the
`N` frequency-domain bins → `2N` time-domain samples mapping, scaled by
`1/2`, with the §4.3.7 overlap-add window already landed at
`celt_mdct_window`), the §4.3.7 *weighted overlap-add* (`celt_overlap_add`
— the stateful per-channel adder that windows each `2N` inverse-MDCT
block with the low-overlap synthesis window and overlap-adds the leading
half with the previous block's windowed trailing half at hop `N`,
carrying the overlap history across frames and reconstructing the
aliasing-free time-domain signal), and the §4.5 redundancy /
mode-transition state-reset machinery. The allocation orchestration and
the PVQ shape decode are partially landed; the §4.3.5 anti-collapse and
wiring the now-complete time-domain chain (denormalise → inverse MDCT →
weighted overlap-add → post-filter → de-emphasis) into a full CELT
decode loop are the remaining decode milestones.

- Black-box invocations of the `opusdec` / `opusenc` binaries (not
  their source) as opaque validators.
